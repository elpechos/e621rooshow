==Windows Install Instructions==

Unzip to a folder
Double click "E621RooShow.Windows.exe"

==Linux Install Instructions==

The linux version of the application requires the mono runtime as well as GTK bindings.
This is what works for me on Ubuntu:

apt-get install mono-runtime
apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil
apt-get install libmono-system-core4.0-cil
mono E621RooShow.Linux.exe

If people could send me instructions for other distributions I'd be happy to include them.
